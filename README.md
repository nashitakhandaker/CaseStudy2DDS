# About
This project explores the use of data science and AI to predict the age of abalones using physical shell measurements. Traditional methods for determining abalone age are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. By applying statistical modeling techniques, we demonstrate how biological growth patterns can be captured and quantified more efficiently.

In addition to predictive modeling, this project includes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that enables natural-language exploration of abalone data, as well as an interactive RShiny dashboard for visual analysis. Together, these components showcase an end-to-end approach that combines explainable regression models with modern AI-driven data interaction tools.
